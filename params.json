{"name":"Community Firn Model","tagline":"Department of Earth & Space Sciences, University of Washington","body":"# The Project\r\nThis project is funded by the National Science Foundation's Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) program. The University of Washington group is one of several institutions working on the International Collaboration and Education in Ice Core Science (ICEICS), grant. The goal of the ICEICS project is to use ice-core science to produce a continuous record of the earth's climate for the past 800,000 years. For more information on this project, please visit the ICEICS homepage.\r\n\r\nThe University of Washington ICEICS group is currently developing state-of-the-art models to reconstruct the physics of the snow-ice transition and gas transport properties in firn. These community models will be open source and freely downloadable. This modeling work has two components: the gas transport, and firn densification. Only the firn densification model is currently available for download. \r\n\r\nThe firn densification model allows the user to choose which physics to include in the model run and which outputs to produce, all based on a simple config file. Users can also alter the source code as needed. The transient models allow physic properties to evolve over time, which results in more accurate delta-age approximations at times of rapid climate change in the past. \r\n\r\nThe models are written in the Python programming language. Python offers an open-source access, ease of development, and scientific computing capabilities.\r\n\r\n# Structure\r\nThe structure of the code is as follows:\r\n\r\n    code/\r\n        firn_density_spin.py\t\r\n        firn_density_nospin.py\r\n        diffusion.py\r\n        physics.py\r\n        hl_analytic.py\r\n        constants.py\r\n        solver.py\r\n        reader.py\r\n        writer.py\r\n        main.py\r\n\r\n# Running the Code\r\nIn order to run, make sure all dependencies has been downloaded. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
